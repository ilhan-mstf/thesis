\begin{abstract}
In this thesis (re-)usage of discarded materials in the process of art making and the artwork itself is explored (or researched). Why and how are they used by the artist? Are there any differences with the original items compared to discarded items? (In other words using has using discarded materials or trash specific (or special) meaning and message?) This is a work to explore the re-usage of trash in artworks (place or the role in the art practice). (and also in which scope? medium, message, life practice\ldots) 

Actually (It is questioned that) working with trash dictates a life practice and, it is a convergence of behavioral patterns (attitudes toward to trash) and art making. The process effects how one's lives and lifestyle. (But what type of interaction between life and art making process?) (This claim is the main driving force of my artwork which is part of a thesis.)

With the help of art discarded thing can be find a place in the society. This issue is examined through the trash which is discarded by the society. By the help of artistic approach things can be gain new values and meaning even if they are discarded and excluded from daily life. The relationship between value creation and artistic practice examined through the artworks that uses trash as medium and representation.

From periods where manual labor and long struggle required in production process and materials are reused and transformed again and again, have reached to periods where production process speeds up and becomes more accessible. Consumption habits have changed radically and have created piles of trash that is not obvious how to reuse them. In this work the practice and process of reusing and transforming trash which is an alternative to today's existing production and consumption habits is investigated. Stages and expression of this practice is examined with my artwork in the context of art.

\textbf{Questions.} Do she/he want to take back (or revisit) the trash once thrown away? People do not want to think of what they throw away. Turning them to a things that worth to look again. How do artists reflect garbage and what are their tactics? What is the thing that add value to trash and what is the role of art in that?

\textbf{Statement.} With the help of art discarded things ---in the scope of thesis trash especially paper trash--- can be transformed beyond the other industrial (or technological) methods.

\textbf{Statement.} Using trash can not only understand in ecological perceptions, it also have powerful political claims. Or it should be examined in deeper levels beyond collage and assemblage, the medium itself has different meanings.
