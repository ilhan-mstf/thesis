% The work that follows is divided into three sections

% The artist thinks, acts, performs music, and writes outside the framework that society has created.

% This thesis takes a rather different approach to the resonant possibilities of discarded things. It looks to philosophical ideas and our entangled experiences of things, time and stories, which need to be traversed in order for a discarded object to be called ‘waste’.

% I also want to suggest a different way of considering trash. Maybe art maybe suggest an alternative way of seeing.

% I’d like to criticize a set of concepts or ways of thinking about discarded things that to me just don’t seem quite adequate.

% In an effort to expand art activism's capacity to create real social change, this article will (1) examine the theoretical framework behind art activism and art's efficacy in accessing emotional pathways; (2) explicate ways to strategically approach art activism through the use of specific case studies; and (3) explain one practical form of art activism-theater-based conflict resolution-that is transforming the ways communities are addressing social injustice.

% This thesis is written as a study of the socio-economic change that is currently happening in Serbia, but it’s a study that critically engages with everyday materials that provide the basis for change, rather than the economic development philosophies that are practiced through policy.

% Her alanda recycling var olabilir, literatürde de vardır?
\comment{WHAT, WHERE?} Literature is recycled material, a pretext for making more art. I learned this distillation of lots of literary criticism in workshops with children. I also learned that creative and critical thinking are practically the same faculty, since both take a distance from found material and turn it into stuff for interpretation. For a teacher of literature over a long lifetime, these are embarrassingly basic lessons to be learning so late, but I report them here for anyone who wants to save time and stress.

\comment{MOVES} \paraphrase{Igor Kopytoff, a professor of anthropology, introduced the notion of commoditization “as a process of becoming rather than as an all-or-none state of being.” As such, Kopytoff wrote, the biography of an object was considerably similar to that of a person: occupying different positions, leading diverse careers in the course of different periods between a beginning and an end, being defined by different regimes of value that are both economically and culturally inscribed.

\comment{TRASH MOVES.} Here the important thing is moving nature of trash. Objects moves and gains different meanings through this movement. Sometimes it becomes artwork, sometimes it becomes archaeological part, waits in the dump-site or wait to be recycle. It also signifies that it is relative and result of a classification issue. All of them are creates a harmony. supports each other with different words and conceptualization.

How does it intersect with other people in which places? This part also can be understand by pointing out different part of it with detailed explanation. For example an artist collect from trash from streets and the other one goes to the (For example Vik Muniz) landfill. In other words there are different places to touch on trash. Every place generates different story? Or to understand it more deeply it covers different part of it. Or provides ideas about it. Lots of people touches it from philosophers to artist. Also in the later parts it draws attention to them.}

\comment{TRASH MOVES.} \paraphrase{Trash moves, all the time. It becomes a steadily growing heap of clutter behind closed walls, accumulates and festers under tight lids, travels from a small trash can in the kitchen to a large one on the curbside, joins other people’s rubbish when the garbage truck arrives, drives to the transfer station, where it circles around on conveyer belts, bids farewell to recyclable or composable goods, is loaded (if declared useless: the ultimate trash) into yet another garbage truck, or barge, or even train, until it arrives at its final destination: a sanitary landfill. Even in the landfill, it does not remain still. Monster "waste handling dozers" move rubbish around, compact it and press it against the soil. More importantly, they incessantly “sculpt” refuse with their huge shovels and caterpillar wheels, making sure the garbage mound does not tip over to create a fetid avalanche. When night falls, and the trash load of the day finally disappears under a thick layer of mud, detritus still moves: once underground, it settles differently, and decomposes at a different speed, thus continuously altering landfill topography: where there was an even plateau, now there is an abruptly descending slope, and a valley; and where there was a perfectly smooth road, now there are deep crevices in the pavement. This is how trash moves. But\ldots who moves on trash? In the United States, it is mostly big-wheeled machines, an industrious army of giant yellow insects busying themselves on a heap of rubbish. In Latin America, it is mostly people. People who hand-pick garbage, who build their shacks on densely compacted trash layers, and who, day in and day out, eagerly throw themselves into the boisterous cascades of fresh debris falling from garbage trucks. In many of the garbage dumps around the world, scavenging becomes a steady job. \quotes{Garbage properly \quotes{stored} and put away brings peace of mind, as do corpses boxed and buried, or criminals confined to a cell.} And thanks to Art: for Art shows how trash--even the one that stops moving, and particularly the one that lies squished, squashed, and weathered, almost fossilized, on the ground---has the potential to move: to move us, that is.

\comment{ANALOGY Between landfill and graveyards. WHOSE TRASH?} \quotes{There’s a relationship between graveyards and landfills, one that makes us uncomfortable, Zubiaurre explained. \quotes{What is happening to trash is what is going to happen to us. We’re all going to end up in a dump, and we’re going to decompose. That’s the ultimate destiny of humankind, and we don’t want to face that.} Trash is also regarded differently, depending on where you live. Last year, an undergrad in Zubiaurre’s honors collegium seminar went to a poor neighborhood and scavenged through people’s trash; no one cared, Zubiaurre said. But when the same student went to Beverly Hills to go through trash, the police were nearly called. \quotes{Who decides what is public and what is private? How come trash becomes highly private in a rich neighborhood, but truly disposable in a poor neighborhood?} Zubiaurre said.} \cite{zubiaurre2015trash}

\comment{TRASH AND OTHER DISCARDED NOTIONS} From my point of view and approach in this thesis, trash is only one of the thing that is being discarded by humans and communities. There are lots of things that are being excluded such as homosexuals, trans, disabled peoples etc. Even if they are excluded, there is also life for them.

\comment{INTERACTION WITH GARBAGE. VALUE SYSTEM, DECIDING TO GARBAGE.} \paraphrase{"The Trash Talk project emphasizes the complex, yet overlooked, relationships that garbage and people share. In terms of their relationship to garbage, all people interact with it on two levels. One is a material connection, indicative of the physical and sensory contacts that people have with garbage. In some households, this connection begins with an individual removing an item from packaging, disposing of that item in the kitchen receptacle, placing that item and others into a larger bin, taking that bin to the curbside, and then the material connection ends. Others, including workers in sanitation plants and recycling centers, then continue a material connection with the garbage, but the material connection of the consumer and the garbage ends with the bin on the curbside. The second connection that people maintain with garbage is an ideational one. Unlike the material one, which is manifested in things that can be touched, moved, and sensed, the ideational connection operates on the level of cognition. The differentiation of an item of value from an item of trash, for example, has nothing to do with the material principles of the object. Instead, humans determine whether the object is of value or whether it is considered trash. The decision of whether an individual decides to dispose of a broken radio or to consider it an heirloom to be kept is highly subjective and rooted in the value systems of a culture." "After the item is eaten, the individual has to decide what to do with the remainder, such as the leftover package. The package might be reused, re-purposed, or recycled but, most likely, will be disposed of in the trash." \cite{lukas2012culture}}

% FROM Garbage in Modern Thought, Encyclopedia
\comment{THROW AWAY CULTURE.} \paraphrase{"Philosophers and intellectuals have expressed the need to focus on the centrality of garbage, but for everyday individuals, the understanding of garbage is often as something “out of sight, out of mind.”" "Modern humans, as part of their penchant for consumption and unsustainable living, often think very little about the waste that they produce." "Like many aspects of capitalist living, the person throwing away a piece of trash does not connect the various levels of production, consumption, and post-consumption involved in the trash. It becomes a secondary matter---an afterthought." "Martin O’Brien, among many thinkers, argues that the understanding of garbage should be a central concept, especially since garbage typically correlates with social change, social roles, and institutions. Thus, beyond the level of individuals and their relationship to garbage, there is an interest in understanding the central role that garbage plays in all of society’s roles, institutions, and forms of change." "Garbage is excess--- it is a part of society that society no longer desires." \cite{lukas2012garbage}}

% FROM Garbage in Modern Thought, Encyclopedia
\comment{CATEGORIZATION.} \paraphrase{"Garbage is categorization, according to Susan Strasser." "In recycling programs and in places of refuse disposal, items of trash are categorized depending on their potential value, possible environmental harm, or time of decay. Consumers have become accustomed to the categories that are often applied to garbage. Many cities require people to dispose of their garbage in an orderly fashion---perhaps separating wet household waste from dry---and recycling programs ask individuals to divide their recyclable items into sets (such as plastic, glass, aluminum, and paper) and smaller subsets (such as PET or 01, PE-HD or 02, and PVC or 03). Garbage is an illustration of how humans use mental categories to order the material world." \cite{lukas2012garbage}}

% Garbage is universal, reference
\comment{NO VALUE, UNIVERSAL} \paraphrase{"According to John Scanlon, garbage is indicative of a separation of the world---the desirable from the unwanted. Michael Thompson uses the riddle of the rich and poor person’s approach to snot (one keeps his in a handkerchief, the other disposes of it with a tissue) to underscore the curious ways in which garbage is connected to the issue of value. While garbage is universal---all societies, extinct and extant, have produced or produce garbage--- the conditions under which garbage is understood are culturally determined. Many non-Western societies attach a much greater value to items after they are discarded. In the United States and many other nations, garbage often results not because something no longer has utilitarian value but because the item in question is defined as something of no value. Thus, garbage is not only an objective condition of material culture, but also a subjective one of mentalist culture. People define what is trash and what is valuable." \cite{lukas2012garbage}}

% Hepsinin ayrı bir manası olması falan.
\comment{Semiotic Context, juxtapositions} \paraphrase{"In popular writing (such as novels), in television, films, music, and other forms of mass expression, the term trash is used to signify work that is of especially low value." \cite{lukas2012garbage}}

Benjamin’s importance as a theorist of the everyday is most evident in his attention to the everyday experiences of modernity. In the face of the endless proliferation of trash, Benjamin potentially suggests a \singlequotes{trash aesthetics} that could be used radically and critically to attend to the everyday.

\comment{LIFE AN OBJECT} \paraphrase{In light of this argument, one could claim that the end of the life of an object corresponds to the moment in which it is disposed of. This disposal might take place in different forms and for different reasons; however, in the most literal and common sense, the life of an object ends in a trash can in the form of waste. In this moment, the object is left valueless in all the possible meanings of the term value: It can no more serve a function, it can on no account be exchanged for anything else, and it can by no means engage in the processes of signification to connote and endow its user with specific social values.} \todo[inline]{reference, (Trashion: The Return of the Disposed by Bahar Emgin)}

% FROM Trashion: The Return of the Disposed by Bahar Emgin
\comment{REFLOW IN THE MARKET} \paraphrase{Referring to the work of Susan Strasser, Hawkins argues that disposal was central to the logic of mass production and hence should not be assessed as only particular to consumerism in the twentieth century: “Mass production of objects and their consumption depends on widespread acceptance of, even pleasure in, exchangeability; replacing the old, the broken, the out of fashion with the new. The capacity for serial replacement is also the capacity to throw away without concern.”} \todo[inline]{reference, (Trashion: The Return of the Disposed by Bahar Emgin)}

\comment{TECHNICAL PROBLEM, NEED TO MANAGED, RECYCLING (CAPITALISM), UPCYCLING} \paraphrase{On the contrary, with respect to the issue of disposability, waste was handled merely “as a technical problem, something to be administered by the most efficient and rational technologies of removal.” Only through the rise of environmental movements in the 1960s did the disposal of waste come to be loaded with negative meanings and iewed through a moral framework. The enormous quantities of waste accumulating in urban centers, Hawkins writes in “Plastic Bags,” were not only taken as a threat to the environment, but also as a sign of an individualistic, insensitive, and hedonistic consumer society. Waste now became evil. If the environment is to be saved from our destructive power, then waste should be “managed,” Hawkins asserts. Consequently, recycling gained its contemporary prominence “as virtue-added disposal\ldots disposal in which the self is morally purified, disposal as an act of redemption.” Disposal in the form of recycling is now a moralistic attitude through which we pay the debt we owe to the world. Upcycling... On the other side of the coin is the business stemming from these practices; recyclers not only ease their conscience through recycling; they also make a profit. Recycling, as “the huge tertiary sector devoted to getting rid of things, is central to the maintenance of capitalism; it doesn’t just allow economies to function by removing excess and waste—it is an economy, realizing commercial value in what’s discarded,” Hawkins and Muecke write in Culture and Waste. In the same manner, upcycling has already been turned into a business: Certain designers labeled eco-friendly are earning money through upcycling, competitions are organized around trashion, numerous websites are devoted to promoting and selling upcycled objects, and online and print resources explain how to upcycle at home. In short, there is a whole sector of upcycling now.} \todo[inline]{reference, (Trashion: The Return of the Disposed by Bahar Emgin)}

\comment{DESIGN, ALTERNATIVE DICIPLINE.} \paraphrase{Design, as a conduit of disposal, reintroduces rubbish as objects of distinction, invaluable and potentially priceless. People are often eager to see objects that were once considered useless and tasteless when they have been invigorated with new life.} \todo[inline]{reference, (Trashion: The Return of the Disposed by Bahar Emgin)}

\comment{UPCYCLING, sample thesis statement sentence} \paraphrase{This article is about those objects that are recreated from trash through the process of upcycling. Upcycling is a term used by architect and designer William McDonaugh and chemist Michael Braungart and refers to “the process of converting an industrial nutrient (material) into something of similar or greater value, in its second life.” I argue that design, in this instance, acts as a tool of transformation and reintroduces into certain orders what was once deemed waste. This theory counters the argument that an object is dead once it is disposed of.} \todo[inline]{Reference, (Trashion: The Return of the Disposed by Bahar Emgin).}

\comment{CATEGORIZATION OF WASTE} \paraphrase{Douglas argues that our classification of dirt lies not with what objects are but where those objects are. (Think that the transformation process. Previous argument support that the transformation of trash is possible by changing the place of them. In other words removing them from landfill and waste bins to the book selves accomplish to transform trash.) ‘Dirt’, writes Douglas, ‘is the by-product of a systematic ordering and classification of matter, in so far as ordering involves rejecting inappropriate elements’. For Douglas dirt is a spatial problem, a question of not what stuff is but where it is.} \todo{Reference, (Waste by William Viney).} 

\comment{CATEGORIZATION OF WASTE} \paraphrase{“Dirt”, writes Douglas, “is the by-product of a systematic ordering and classification of matter, in so far as ordering involves rejecting inappropriate elements.” Dirt is only dirty in certain places, when it is out of its correct position. Just as faces, for example, is considered dirty when it is in our kitchens but not when it is in our bodies, so it is that our classification of waste depends on the location of objects.}  \todo{Reference, (Waste by William Viney).}

\comment{Crowdsourcing artworkümde neden insanlardan topladığımı, neden onları kullanıdığımı anlatacağım yer ile ilgili olabilir.}

%*************************************
% Phrases...
% What specific social issues are you trying to address through Labyrinth?
% In view of the diversity of online crowdsourced art projects, as illustrated by the examples cited so far, it is useful to map out this artistic trend by developing a comprehensive and multidimensional typology of online crowdsourced art. Table 1 organizes this classification according to a set of multiple criteria. (But this one can be used at introduction, but it is too long to fit on introduction. Maybe select works by giving prominence to some of the features. So the approach to the trash is going to be introduced and also it is reveals the what i am doing in this context.) (A Typology of Online Crowdsourced Art. Diye bir örnek var aslında benzer bir şekilde bu trash içinde yapılabilir.) 
\subsection{Crowdsourcing, Participation, Open Work}
\todo[inline]{TODO needs reference, FROM Crowdsourced Art and Collective Creativity}
In the words of Jeff Howe (2006b), the Wired columnist who coined this term in June 2006, \quotes{crowdsourcing represents the act of a company or institution taking a function once performed by employees and outsourcing it to an undefined (and generally large) network of people in the form of an open call}. The vital elements that qualify an outreach strategy as crowdsourcing are, according to Howe, the use of the open call format and the reliance on a large network of potential workers. Although in some cases there is a material reward for the best contributions, the existence of financial incentives is not a required feature in crowdsourcing. Because of the diversity of its applications, crowdsourcing continues to be a disputed term in both the scholarly literature and the popular press; Howe’s original definition is, in this sense, a helpful delineation of its practical sphere.

The value of crowdsourcing lies in the collective intelligence of the contributors. Pierre Levy (1997) describes this concept as “a form of universally distributed intelligence, constantly enhanced, coordinated in real time, and resulting in the effective mobilization of skills” (p. 13). The question of collective intelligence—and its potential efficiency in various practical settings—has received much attention in both academia and journalism. Researchers studying team performance generally agree that, under the right circumstances and with appropriate motivation, large groups of people can work together and harness their collective intelligence to achieve efficient results (Benkler, 2006; Rheingold, 2002; Surowiecki, 2004). Nevertheless, artistic creativity is different from innovation and intelligence, and it requires a unique set of skills and sensibilities as well as a particular type of cultural capital; if we admit that crowds can have collective intelligence, do they also have collective creativity in an artistic sense?

All these pages are rescued and with their [hi]story they are separated from unused new produced blank sheets and notebooks. They are not bought, not gift. They are found. They are accepted. One of the most creative medium is paper and pencil. Chance given to the people through this work.

However, in view of its reliance on the artistic contribution of a large pool of usually anonymous participants, this type of art raises important questions about notions of collective creativity, authorship, collaboration, and the shifting structure of artistic production in the new digital environment. It is well studied area. Pick a method here. Transforming trash with collaboration.

As curator Andrea Grover notes, “having the audience become co-creators is not a new impulse”; the Internet simply offered a new platform to accomplish this goal (Strickland, 2011, para. 5).

Here this question can be raised about why this type collaboration. Another option can be working together with people on a table. Creating things at that time and transforming the objects here. Possibly the connection to the people will more realistic and intense. However same things can be succeed on the internet at some level. 

While crowdsourced art challenges the traditional role of the artist, it simultaneously redefines the conventional function of the public, turning them from passive receivers into engaged producers. (This totally a new area to discuss, I'm going to summarize and introduce concepts and debates. How are they support my work and how they are give way to me?)

% This article therefore aims to fill these critical gaps by analyzing the practice of online crowdsourced art within a framework of collective creativity and participation theories. Principally, my interest is in answering two key questions. What is crowdsourced art and how can it be classified? And how does the structure of the artwork determine the degree or significance of participation?

% why collaboration, is it really a collaboration? It is methodology used in my practice.

\comment{How does it become trash?, initial function.} when an object is discarded it is perceived as being no longer of value to the person or society that once possessed it.

[Chapter 2] rubbish Theory \comment{DEFINITION} Rubbish is, by definition, an object that is not or is no longer, owned by anyone, that falls outside all categories of economics, culture, and social control. As one of many things on the garbage heap, a discarded object even tends to take on a negative value as something unsanitary, dangerous. The socially constructed value of the object has shifted over time from its finite life span of usefulness and meaning to a timeless and valueless of socially sanctioned rubbish. 

[Chapter 2] \comment{Capitalism, market.} The remarkable thing about many of these objects - especially those produced in the last of the twentieth century - is that they were specifically designed to end up on the garbage heap. They were designed to decrease in value over time - to be used one, or twice and than to be thrown away. This applies not only applies packing - designed containers that protect and promote products - but to an ever expanding list of products. themselves. \todo[inline]{Waste and wantta bununla ilgili bir bölüm olmalı.}

[building new things from ruin] \comment{small amount of it} while most waste ends up in these unsanitary and unsightly landfills, some small percentage is reincorparated --- or recycled --- back into the economic and cultural system of the local population. Indeed, this is the power of rubbish as a category of possessable objects: it has within itself the potential of being discovered, retrieved, and transformed back into an object of greater or lesser durability. 

[Resistance] \comment{Resistance, tactile, agnes varda?} If it is ultimately romantic to speak of these toys (or any other modern-day recyclia) in the language of resistance (by which I mean self-conscious political opposition), I would agree with Marshal Sahlins's assertion that "whether or not it comes to this [resistance], the indigenous mode of response to imperialism is always culturally subversive, insofar as the people must need to interpret the experience and they can do so only according to their own principles of existence. (sahlins 1992, 16)"

\comment{hybrid} each recycled object contains within it a reference to two or more distinct times. \comment{not every time actually, if you transfor ok. it applicable for my case.} Whatever their ultimate design or destination, these recycled artifacts are, by definition, "impure", "inauthentic" products of past and present, here and there, "us" and "them" (clifford 1992) \todo{ref.}

[Reasons of recycling] \comment{Economic conditions forces to people recycle and reuse. but even if they have no economical struggle, they continue recycle. what is the reason of it.} Recycling as an economic strategy of survival in developing countries throughout the world. creative production that is motivated, primarily, by adverse conditions of economic necessity. (lanfill orchestra here. bookcovers here.) Economic survival and adaptation are influential factors for both the makers, who build informal business on the making and selling of recycled goods, and the local consumers, for whom the market for affordable, utilitarian goods is devised.
